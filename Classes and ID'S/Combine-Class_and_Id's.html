        Differences between Classes and IDs <br><br>
        Uniqueness  : IDs must be unique within a document, meaning only one element can have a particular ID. Classes can
        be used multiple times across different elements.<br>
        Specificity : ID selectors have higher specificity in CSS than class selectors. This means styles defined with
        IDs will override those defined with classes if both are applied to the same element.
